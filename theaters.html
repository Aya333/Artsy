     <h1>History of theaters in Europe </h1>
     <h2>Ancient greece (From the 7th century if not older)</h2>
     <img src="gr.jpg" alt="Greek">
     <p class="p1"> Theater's were originated in ancient greece 5,000 years BC, as they were the first to present dramatic presentation.
          In ancient greece it was a part of religious riruals founded by Dionysus the "god of fertility and wine" his followers
          -looking back at them now- were basically a cult so they celebrated him in exciting occasiong by his devotees females
          in particular as they start performing and dance themselves to madness while carrying symbols and tear pieces of animals they
          have just killed and guzzle the raw flesh </p>

          <p>Later on it developed into a different form of drama they would sing and dance not in a ritualistic way.
              And old greece theaters revolved around three main forms :
              <ol>
              <li>Drama</li>
              <li>Tragedy</li>
              <li>Comedy</li>
            </ol>
              One of the well known first actors from that era is Thespis although it's not clearly known whether he was an actor
              or a priest but he has been a well known name for centuries and actors often wore masks so they could perform
              more than one roll.

        <h2>Roman Theatres (From the 4th century BC)</h2>
        <img src="roman.jpg" alt="Roman">
        <p class="p2">Roman theaters were heavely influenced by Greek theaters but it was mostly revolved aroung the drama, subplots,
            characters and the play it self it was not about religion in any way.

        </p>
       <p>
           Back in the days audiences were rude and wouldn't applaud they would be mean and act as if the play was boring
           because of the way characters are presented therefore the actors developed a new method that would keep the guests 
           entertained and interested in the characters that method was about trying to let the audience guess the characters state 
           by only looking at them for example:
           <ul>
               <li>A black wig means that the actor is a young male</li>
               <li> A red wig means the character was a slave</li>
               <li>A yellow robe means the character was a woman</li>
               <li>A yellow tassel means the character was a god</li>
           </ul>
           Overall it was different a bit from Greek theaters.

              <h2>Medieval European Theaters (From the 5th century)</h2>
       <img src="medieval.jpg" alt="medieval">
       <p class="p3">
           The raise of these theaters were hundred years after the fall of the roman empires as the roman catholic religion
           was dominante it had a huge role in the raise of theaters it was used to celebrate religion like the old greek theaters
           and actors were priests and church members not to mention those plays were written in latin.
       </p>
       <p>
           Later on Vernacular dramas appeared and were written in common languages therefore it was performed in the towns square 
           on front of huge crowds because everyone understood what was being said.
           Vernacular dramas were in three types:
           <ul>
               <li>Mystery Plays: which were based on old and new testaments</li>
               <li>Miracle Plays: Which were based on the life of saints</li>
               <li>Morality Plays: taught a lesson through symbolic characters representing faults.</li>
           </ul>
