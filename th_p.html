Locations:The streets of Milan literally become a runway during Fashion Week. 
Although you do need to buy a ticket for some events, 
many of the Milan shows are held in public venues. Some of the venues open to the public include the Piazza Duomo, 
Milan’s central square, the Arco Della Pace and the Castello Sforzesco courtyard. 
It is also tradition to hold shows in Milan’s old Palazzos,
 such as the Palazzo Reale and Palazzo Serbelloni.
