        <h3>When was the first Fashion week in Milans history ?? </h3>
        <img class="m2" src="imagesmil/vintage.jpg"/>  
      <p> Milan Fashion Week was and is still one of Milan's biggest events every year.
          It was born in 1958, with the establishment of the National Chamber for Italian Fashion 
          (or Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana). This organization serves as the regulating body for Italian fashion,
           and also the organizer of most Milan shows during Fashion week.
           Of course, there are always exceptions — Dolce & Gabbana and Gucci organize their shows independently from the Chamber. </p>
           
       
       <h3>A brief back-ground on the topic</h3>

      <P >
        With a fashion industry specializing in luxury goods dating back to the middle ages, the city of Milan,
         Italy has a well-earned reputation as one of the most stylish cities in the world. Historically, 
         Milan developed a name for high-quality textiles and tailoring. During the 19th Century, 
         the Milanese began adapting Parisian styles to fit local tastes, which generally tended to be simpler and more conservative than their French counterparts.

      <p>
        In the 20th Century, Milan continued to grow as an international trendsetter for the latest fashions, with a number of big designers making the city their home.
         Milan fashion trends became popular for their simplicity and elegance… and for being more affordable than the fashion emerging from Paris and Florence.
